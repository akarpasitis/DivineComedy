Divine Comedy is based on a 2D Action shooter game called Downwell. The objective of the Downwell is to descend chasms and caves and blast your way across blocks and enemies to reach the end goal. We liked the idea of falling and shooting, so we decided to take that element of Downwell and turn it into a 3D FPS game.

The essence of Divine Comedy is to fall and shoot at the same time, while maintaining the right altitude and speed so that you can collect halos and reach the end of each level with as many halos as possible. The gun mechanics devised by Witek allowed the player to fire the gun and generate knockback. That allowed the player to navigate through the level. Damage to platforms and to the character if the player landed too harshly was also added, in order to add a sense of danger. The player's view was rotated on its access so that the character seemed like he was always falling instead of the traditional eyes forward camera standard FPS games used. That's immediately noticeable as you leap off platforms and blasting down at blocks.

The entire project proved to be quite the challenge for our team. There were many obstacles that we managed to overcome to produce what we have now. Given that the five of us had never worked with each other in a project in the past, I'm actually pleased with what we created. However, I think given more favorable circumstances, our project could have been much better, which is why I plan on adding a few more details in the near future to further realise our vision.

Firstly, the demands of Unreal Engine 4 on all of our systems, even during the early stages of development, was staggering. On my 6 year old MacBook Pro, Unreal would crash at least nine to ten times during  8 hours of working on the project. My teammates also had similar issues, so that limited the number of caves, produced by Nikita's cave generation code, we could put in the game level. Masking levels off didn't help, as I could only add one or two 15x15x70 caves before the lag was crippling. Reducing the texture resolution for meshes wasn't that much of a help either. I even took out enemies, and various special effects that I had done for landing and shooting. That is evident in video tech demo, where the game barely runs at 20 FPS with its bare bones.
